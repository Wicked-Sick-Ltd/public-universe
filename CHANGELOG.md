# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Fair-use note for bulk REST access: send `X-PU-Api-Key`; a missing, invalid, or revoked key stays anonymous. Cloudflare Pro still caps every IP, keyed or not, at 300 requests per minute. See [fair-use.md](docs/fair-use.md). The website and API enforcement live in `solar-system-web` and `solar-system-db`.

## 0.4.2 (2026-11-11)

### Changed

- Advertised remote MCP URL is `https://api.publicuniverse.net/mcp`. `https://api.sol.wickedsick.com/mcp` keeps working: the two hosts serve in parallel, with no redirect.

## 0.4.1 (2026-10-16)

### Added

- Cursor marketplace manifest (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`), generated from `plugin.json` with category `education`, logo, keywords and MCP/skills paths.

### Changed

- README and submission docs reflect a live public MCP endpoint (verified 2026-10-16) and a public `Wicked-Sick-Ltd/public-universe` repository.
- [validation.md](docs/validation.md) records full initialize, tool-list and sample tool-call evidence.

## 0.4.0 (2026-10-09)

First public release as **Public Universe** (`publicuniverse`). It also ships the
0.2.0 and 0.3.0 changes below, which were never tagged separately. Based on
`main` at `4544cb4772277805d90aeefb0c1601402c893979`.

### Added
- Claude Code marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), which Grok CLI also reads, an MCP Registry `server.json` and a Grok CLI profile (`clients/grok.toml`) (#3).
- Install steps for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Grok and generic MCP clients, plus draft directory listing copy in `docs/listings.md` (nothing submitted) (#3).
- `NOTICE` asking reusers to credit "Wicked Sick Ltd" (#3).
- Native Gemini extension and portable Agent Plugins packaging for Codex, Cursor and Copilot, generated from shared manifests, with drift checks and offline CI (#1, #2).

### Changed
- **Breaking for existing installs:** the MCP server identifier is now `publicuniverse` instead of `solar-system-db` in every manifest, client profile and skill. Tool names are unchanged, but client tool prefixes and saved permission allowlists change (#3).
- Display name is "Public Universe"; the audit skill is now `publicuniverse-data-audit` (#2, #3).
- Licence copyright holder is Wicked Sick Limited; licence remains MIT (#3).
- Repository metadata now points at `Wicked-Sick-Ltd/publicuniverse-plugin` (#3).

### Known limitations

Resolved by 0.4.2:

- The repository is `Wicked-Sick-Ltd/public-universe` and is public. GitHub redirects `solar-plugin`. At 0.4.0 it was still `Wicked-Sick-Ltd/solar-plugin`, so links that used `publicuniverse-plugin` returned 404.
- `https://api.sol.wickedsick.com/mcp` initializes (HTTP 200, 33 read-only tools, `serverInfo.name` `solar-system-db` 1.30.0). At 0.4.0 the origin still returned 404. See [validation.md](docs/validation.md).
- `https://api.publicuniverse.net/mcp` is the advertised URL and accepted `initialize` on 2026-11-11. At 0.4.0 it was planned and not live.
- The repository is public, so install routes no longer wait on an internal repository.

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)
- Rename the package to `publicuniverse` and the audit skill to `publicuniverse-data-audit`.
- Use PublicUniverse branding and `https://publicuniverse.net` for website links.
- Add directory listing descriptions and the website icon to distributable archives.
- Generate a native Gemini extension from the shared manifests; verify Codex and Copilot package installation and skill discovery.
- Accept Windows skill line endings and pin text files to LF for consistent generated-file checks.
- Document the repository transfer, public catalog rollout and remaining live acceptance gates.
- Keep the `solar-system-db` server identifier and existing API URL until the replacement MCP endpoint is confirmed.

## 0.2.0 (unreleased)
- Add portable Agent Plugins packaging for Codex, Cursor and Copilot while retaining Claude compatibility.
- Document ChatGPT hosted MCP connection and separate packaged-skill setup.
- Generate standalone client profiles from one canonical MCP configuration and package metadata.
- Keep all seven skills and their references portable across client tool namespaces.
- Add deterministic packaging, drift checks and offline CI; record pending live endpoint acceptance.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-28)
- First release: connects the public Solar MCP server (`https://api.sol.wickedsick.com/mcp`).
- Skills: tonight-sky, lesson-builder, space-fact-check, object-explainer, close-approach-watch, sky-this-week, solar-data-audit.
- Shared data caveats (moon counts, GM/R² gravity, Venus's two kinds of day, two-body accuracy, UTC).
