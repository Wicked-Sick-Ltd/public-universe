# Directory listing copy

Draft text for public directories. **Nothing here has been submitted.** The repository is public. The 2026-10-16 live MCP check in [validation.md](validation.md) passed against `https://api.sol.wickedsick.com/mcp`; that page also records a 2026-11-11 initialize and tool list on `https://api.publicuniverse.net/mcp`. Submit when review copy is final.

**One-liner (80 characters or fewer):** Free astronomy data and lesson-ready workflows for every AI agent.

**Short description (200 characters or fewer):** Explore 1.5 million solar system objects, plan a night's stargazing, build UK school lessons and fact-check space claims, using live catalogue data from the free Public Universe service.

**Long description:**

> Public Universe is a free, pro bono astronomy service from Wicked Sick Ltd. This plugin connects your agent to its public MCP server (no API key) and adds seven workflows: plan what to see tonight from any town, explain any planet, moon, asteroid or comet at a chosen reading level, build UK key-stage lessons and worksheets with live values, fact-check astronomy claims, track upcoming asteroid and comet close approaches, draft a sourced weekly sky roundup, and audit catalogue data against official sources. Data comes from NASA/JPL, the IAU Minor Planet Center and other public catalogues, with sources, units and retrieval dates kept in every answer. Read-only: it never writes data or controls telescopes. Astronomy, not astrology.

**Example prompts:** "What can I see tonight from Romsey?" / "Explain Saturn to a ten-year-old using live catalogue data." / "Make a Year 5 worksheet about the planets." / "Is Venus's day really longer than its year?" / "Which asteroids pass close to Earth this month?"

## 1. Claude plugin directory (first)

Submit the public repository URL through Anthropic's plugin directory submission form. The repository root has `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; `claude plugin validate .` should pass.

- Plugin name: `publicuniverse`; marketplace name: `publicuniverse`
- Install test: `/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Wicked-Sick-Ltd/public-universe.git` then `/plugin install publicuniverse@publicuniverse`
- Components: 7 skills, 1 remote HTTP MCP server; no hooks, commands, binaries or credentials
- Use the short and long descriptions above.

## 2. Cursor marketplace

Submit at https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish with the repository URL. The root `plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `mcp.json` and `skills/` follow the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 format (plus Cursor's manifest). Logo: `assets/icon.svg`. Description: short description above.

## 3. Official MCP Registry

`server.json` is generated at the repository root with the name `net.publicuniverse/publicuniverse`, which needs DNS verification of `publicuniverse.net`:

```sh
mcp-publisher login dns --domain publicuniverse.net --private-key <key>   # after adding the TXT record
mcp-publisher publish
```

Alternative without DNS: change the name to `io.github.wicked-sick-ltd/publicuniverse` and use `mcp-publisher login github`. The registry requires the remote URL to be publicly reachable, and each URL can belong to only one server name.

## 4. Smithery

Add an existing remote server at https://smithery.ai/new using the MCP URL (no authentication). Display name: Public Universe. Description: short description above. Smithery scans the tool list on submission, so do this after the endpoint works.

## 5. OpenAI / Codex plugin directory

Follow https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission. The root `plugin.json` already carries the `com.openai` interface metadata (display name, descriptions, prompts, icon). Still needed from Wicked Sick: verified developer/business identity, domain verification, per-tool annotation justifications (all tools are read-only), support and terms URLs, a demo recording, and the five positive / three negative reviewer scenarios in [submission.md](submission.md).

## 6. Gemini CLI extensions gallery

The gallery indexes public GitHub repositories that contain `gemini-extension.json`. Add the repository topic `gemini-cli-extension` once public and check the listing at https://geminicli.com/extensions. Install line: `gemini extensions install https://github.com/Wicked-Sick-Ltd/public-universe`.

## 7. Wicked Sick catalogue (`Wicked-Sick-Ltd/ai-marketplace`)

Checked read-only on catalogue `main`. This package does not edit that repository.

Cursor's team marketplace (`.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`) sets `publicuniverse` `source` to `plugins/publicuniverse`. That path is a vendored copy of this package. `plugins/publicuniverse/VENDORED.md` records version 0.4.2 taken from commit `8b1e7b348067194d5a400f6bf16a0144a51d74aa` (the head of pull request 9). The squash merge on this repository's `main` is `f660a494163def6b3d9e4427eebcf9cf1190f052`; both commits have tree `a87cf8ed72e431e692df03732e43014c1fe8f4ea`. Cursor does not import this source repository by URL.

Claude (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), Codex (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) and Copilot (`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`) import `https://github.com/Wicked-Sick-Ltd/public-universe.git` and pin commit `bb5919e47e8c8e1eb66c2fc5dcdba9bbc51b2f56`, labelled 0.4.1. They do not install the vendored `plugins/publicuniverse/` tree. Gemini (`gemini/README.md`) is an install guide, not a JSON catalog, and pins the same commit.

Pin those git imports and the Gemini `--ref` to the reviewed release commit. This repository has no release tag. The 0.4.2 commit on `main` is `f660a494163def6b3d9e4427eebcf9cf1190f052`.
